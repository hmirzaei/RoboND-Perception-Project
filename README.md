# Project: 3D Perception

### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 Pipeline Implementation

#### Excecise 1: Filtering and RANSAC plane fitting

The pipeline for this part of the project is as teh following:

Voxel Grid Filter <sub>![➧](misc/r_arrow.jpg) </sub> Pass through 'Z' axis <sub>![➧](misc/r_arrow.jpg) </sub> Pass through 'Y' axis  <sub>![➧](misc/r_arrow.jpg) </sub> Outlier filtering <sub>![➧](misc/r_arrow.jpg) </sub>
RANSAC plane fitting
